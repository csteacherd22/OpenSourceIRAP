To use an alternative file, rename the desired file to “stimuli.xlsx” and move to the same folder as the psyexp and py files.

The only difference between them is that the Natural Language IRAP contains all the words within the label stimuli. 

NB in order to work, the target stimuli must have present at least one character or PsychoPy will throw and error. As such, the target stimuli contain a single space in the Natural Language IRAP stimuli file.
