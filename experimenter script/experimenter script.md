## Purpose
Due to the fact that the IRAP requires participants to remember and follow a rule rather than simply categorise stimuli, it is objectively harder than tasks such as an IAT and suffers from a higher attrition rate. As such, the large majority of published IRAP work has been conducted one-to-one with a trained researcher who provides verbal instructions during the pracice blocks. Attrition rates when delivered in this way are typically c.10%. Deliver IRAPs in groups or remotely typically results in large attrition rates or unusable data, although this has not been systematically explored. We have found that for participants to complete the IRAP successfully they need to learn the following steps in this specific order. 

1.	Conceptualization: Does the participant understand that they’re not being asked for their personal opinion, but rather to follow a rule?

2. Do they know the two rules, and when they must alternate between them
3. Accuracy: Can they respond accurately?
4. Speed: Are they going as fast as possible?If a participant tries to go quickly before first learning to go accurately, or if they try to be accurate without first understanding that they must be accurate to the rule rather than their own opinion, they are unlikely to complete the IRAP successfully. If a participant is responding very quickly at the sacrifice of accuracy, the experimenter can intervene to undermine this quickly and effectively. The experimenter may stop them mid-practice block and emphasise that they need to concentrate on being accurate first before attempting to go quickly. 

## Script 

NB Text in `code comments` is dependant on the IRAP stimulus set.

- Unlike a questionnaire, which asks you for your personal opinion, this task just asks you to follow a rule. For the moment, that rule is “`flowers are positive and insects are negative`”.
- You will see words related to either `flowers` or `insects` at the top of the screen, and positive and negative words such as “`health`” or “`murder`” in the middle of the screen. You can respond with either “`similar`” or “`different`”. According to the rule – and not necessarily what you believe – is this first trial “`True`” or “`False`”? What was the rule?
- Go as slowly as you need to get them all right according to the rule. You’ll naturally start to go faster when you’ve learned to be accurate.
- Unlike a questionnaire, where you can give whatever answer you want to, in this task if you get one incorrect according to the rule you’ll see a red X. Simply give it the correct answer to continue.
- After every block the rule swaps, there are only two rules. As you can see, now the rule is “`flowers are negative and insects are positive`”.
- Well done. Keep going until the task is complete. Keep being as accurate as you can, and when you’re accurate you’ll naturally go quickly. You can take breaks during the feedback screens if you need to.
